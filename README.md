# Overview
This project is a React-based Strudel Web App that allows users to write, edit and play Strudel live-coding music patterns directly in the browser. It integrates a code editor, sound controls, instrument selection, mute/unmute functionality, and adjustable speed options.

# Controls Description

Play / Pause Button - Starts or stops the playback of the Strudel music code.
Restart Button - Restarts the playback from the beginning.
Mute Button - Instantly mutes or unmutes the audio output without needing to click apply.
Instrument Selector - Lets you choose between different sound presets (synth, bass and default).
Speed Slider - Changes the playback speed (tempo) of the composition.
Apply Button - Updates and applies changes made to instruments, speed and other parameters.
Collapse buttons - Hides and unhides sections of the web app for easier access.

# Hotkeys

For playing and pausing music:

### `Space bar`

For restarting the song:

### `Left arrow key`

For muting and unmuting the audio:

### `M key + Left arrow key`

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run
Extract the project folder from the submission ZIP.
Open JavaScript Debug Terminal in the project root folder.
Run the following scripts:

To install the node modules:

### `npm install`

In the project directory to run the web app:

### `npm start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
